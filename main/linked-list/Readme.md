## Where are linked lists used?

- Used in many list, Queue & Stack implementations.
- Great for creating circular lists.
- Can easily model real world objects such as trains.
- Used in *separate chaining*, which is present in certain hashtable implementations to deal with hashing collisions.
- Often used in the implementation of adjacency for graphs.
