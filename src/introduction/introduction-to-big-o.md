# Introduction to Big-O
As programmers, we often find ourselves asking the same two questions over and over again:
> - How much time does this algorithm need to finish?
> - How much space does this algorithm need fot its computation?

Big-O Notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the **worst case**, helping to quantify the performance as the input size becomes **arbitrarily large**.

## List of complexities
Time | Function
---|---
Constance Time | O(1)
Logarithmic Time | O(Log(n))
Linear Time | O(n)
Linear-Logarithmic Time | O(nLog(n))
Quadratic Time | O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Cubic Time | O(n<sup>3</sup>)
Exponential Time | O(b<sup>n</sup>), b > 1
Factorial Time| O(n!)
