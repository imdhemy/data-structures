## Definition
A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.
## Why Data Structures?
- They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
- They help to manage and organize data.
- They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

<h2 id="abstract-data-types">Abstract Data types (ADT)</h2>
- An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of data structure (DS) which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
- The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.
